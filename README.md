https://wokwi.com/ for Pico simulator (use with most current diagram and main.py in repo). 

Check janky.jpg for a rough idea about what we're working with.

Questions to resolve include but are not limited to:
- Physical case for the Picos and antennas and such
- UI for the Fighter and SAM
- How nRF24L01+ library can handle 'sending' and 'receiving' radar or how we can simulate it
- game parameters and easy variations
- building out user-friendly configuration, such as the ability to open the case and toggle some settings via button.
